# Tries
# 🔠 Tries (Prefix Tree) - DSA

This repository contains the complete implementation and problems related to **Trie Data Structure**, also known as **Prefix Tree**. Tries are an efficient information retrieval data structure used for handling strings, especially in problems involving **search, autocomplete, prefix matching**, and **dictionary-based operations**.

## 📌 Contents

### ✅ Trie Implementation (Basic)
- Custom `Node` class using an array of 26 pointers to represent lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z').
- Efficient Trie structure for prefix-based operations.
- Functions:
  - insert(word)        → Inserts a word into the trie.
  - search(word)        → Checks if a word exists in the trie.
  - startsWith(prefix)  → Checks if any word in the trie starts with the given prefix.

### ✅ Implement Trie II (With Count & Erase)
- Extended Trie with frequency tracking for each word and prefix.
- Custom `Node` class maintains:
  - ew → Number of times a word ends at this node.
  - cp → Number of times a prefix passes through this node.
- Functions:
  - insert(word)                  → Inserts a word and updates prefix + end counts.
  - countWordsEqualTo(word)      → Returns how many times the exact word was inserted.
  - countWordsStartingWith(pre)  → Returns how many words start with the given prefix.
  - erase(word)                  → Deletes one occurrence of the word from the trie.

## 🚀 How to Use

```cpp
Trie* obj = new Trie();
obj->insert("apple");
bool isWordPresent = obj->search("apple");       // true
bool isPrefixPresent = obj->startsWith("app");   // true
